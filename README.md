## Projects

### Chiventure
**Repository:** [Chiventure](https://github.com/Purrsephone/chiventure)

Chiventure is a text-based adventure game built in C. It features dynamic gameplay, including a rich narrative, customizable characters, and an interactive environment. Players can explore various locations, solve puzzles, and interact with NPCs.

### Warmup Project
**Repository:** [Warmup Project](https://github.com/Purrsephone/warmup_project)

This project serves as an introductory exercise to familiarize myself with basic coding concepts. It includes several small programming tasks that cover fundamental principles and help build a solid foundation for future projects.

### Particle Filter Localization
**Repository:** [Particle Filter Localization](https://github.com/Purrsephone/particle_filter_localization_project)

This project implements a particle filter for robot localization, enabling a robot to determine its position within a given environment using sensor data. It demonstrates the principles of probabilistic robotics and showcases the application of algorithms in real-time scenarios.

### Q-Learning Project
**Repository:** [Q-Learning Project](https://github.com/Purrsephone/q_learning_project)

A reinforcement learning project that implements the Q-learning algorithm to train an agent in a grid environment. The agent learns to navigate the grid efficiently and maximize rewards through trial and error.

### Tom and Jerry Game
**Repository:** [Tom and Jerry Game](https://github.com/Purrsephone/tom-jerry)

This is a simple game inspired by the classic cartoon, featuring Tom and Jerry. The project showcases game design principles, character mechanics, and basic collision detection. It's a fun way to apply programming concepts in game development.

### Lab 3
**Repository:** [Lab 3](https://github.com/Purrsephone/lab3)

Lab 3 is a project focused on applying learned concepts from previous lessons. It involves implementing specific algorithms and demonstrating proficiency in problem-solving techniques through coding exercises.

### Basketball Stats
**Repository:** [Basketball Stats](https://github.com/Purrsephone/Basketball_Stats)

A data analysis project that analyzes basketball game statistics. It includes data visualization and statistical analysis techniques to provide insights into player performance and team dynamics.

### LESA-EACL-2021
**Repository:** [LESA-EACL-2021](https://github.com/Purrsephone/LESA-EACL-2021)

This repository is a forked project used for testing potential applications to a separate project. It contains code related to natural language processing and machine learning, which may be relevant for future development.
